  bio: "Anna Beyeler received her undergraduate degree in Biochemistry from the University of Bordeaux in 2006. Her expertise in electrophysiology roots in her doctoral training in the same university, after what she joined the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory (MIT) as post-doctoral fellow. There, she identified circuit and synaptic mechanisms of emotions in the amygdala, underlying memory formation and retrieval of positive and negative associations. After five years abroad, she started her lab in the Neurocentre Magendie within the vibrant Neuroscientific community of Bordeaux. Since then her team is studying the contribution of circuits of the insular cortex to emotional valence and anxiety, as well as the alteration of those circuits in pre-clinical models of psychiatric disorders. They use a wide panel of techniques including fiber photometry recordings, in vivo and ex vivo electrophysiology, opto- and chemo-genetics, along with cutting-edge whole-brain circuit mapping. In 2020, Dr. Beyeler has been tenured as a principal investigator at the French Institute of Health (INSERM). She also received the Avenir fund of INSERM, and grants from ANR, FRM and cercle FSER. She is also an associate member of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ACNP), a member of the FENS-Kavli Network, and an ambassador of the ALBA network for diversity in Neuroscience."
