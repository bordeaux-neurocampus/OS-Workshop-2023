  Emma was formerly Chief Editor of PLOS Biology and worked in scientific 
  publishing for 15 years. She has consulted for the preprint server medRxiv, 
  and has been an Affiliate for bioRxiv for several years. Initially Emma 
  followed a standard research career path, she obtained a PhD from the MRC-LMB 
  in Cambridge in the UK, followed by a postdoc at UC Berkeley. She then moved 
  into science publishing joining PLOS Biology in San Francisco in 2005. She 
  next took the position of Executive Editor of the JCB at Rockefeller University 
  Press, New York in 2007. During this time she gained an enthusiasm for open data, 
  she worked with developers to launch the JCB DataViewer as a tool for making 
  original image data available with published research articles. After relocating 
  back to the UK and working at the University of Dundee first for the funder CR-UK, 
  and then as a Project Manager for the Open Source, Open Microscopy Environment 
  project, Emma eventually re-joined PLOS Biology from 2011 until 2019 where she 
  advanced to the position of Chief Editor. Emma is passionate about all things 
  related to open research, data, code, and method availability alongside the 
  articles, research reproducibility and integrity."

  bio: "Florent is an associate Professor at the INSERM laboratory Cognition, 
  Action and Sensorimotor Plasticity in Dijon. His research projects encompass
  behavioral psychology and cognitive neuroscience. The main goal is to
  understand the link between neural processes underlying motion
  (movement preparation, motor imagery, action language). Ongoing works
  include the development of non-pharmacological interventions, such as
  mental practice or non-invasive brain stimulation, for motor learning
  and rehabilitation of pathologies implying the sensorimotor system.
  Florent is currently part of the managing board of Peer Community In
  Neuroscience, a free recommendation process of scientific preprints
  based on peer reviews."
