Florent is an associate Professor at the INSERM laboratory Cognition, Action and Sensorimotor Plasticity in Dijon. His research projects encompass behavioral psychology and cognitive neuroscience. The main goal is to understand the link between neural processes underlying motion (movement preparation, motor imagery, action language). Ongoing works include the development of non-pharmacological interventions, such as mental practice or non-invasive brain stimulation, for motor learning and rehabilitation of pathologies implying the sensorimotor system. Florent is currently part of the managing board of Peer Community In Neuroscience, a free recommendation process of scientific preprints based on peer reviews.
