Since September 2020 I am responsible for the implementation of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) in France at the Ministry of Higher Education and Research, and since February 2022 I am co-chair of the EOSC Steering Board. I finished my PhD in astrophysics at Hamburg University in 2001, and worked in astrophysics and space science in Italy, Switzerland and at NASA's Goddard space flight center and taught at the University of Maryland Baltimore County. In 2009 I became researcher at CNRS in France and from 2016 to 2020 I was scientific director for Computing and Data Science at the national institute for particle, astroparticle, and nuclear physics (CNRS-IN2P3). I was work package leader in the EOSCpilot and in the EOSC-Pillar project before joining the ministry.
